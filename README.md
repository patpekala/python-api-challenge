# WeatherPy and VacationPy

# WeatherPy

  ## Overview
    
  Using Python, visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator to create a representative model of weather across cities.

  ## Technologies 
  - Python 
  - Jupyter Notebook 
  - APIs
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib

  ## Analysis
  - There is no relationship between Latitude and Wind Speed. As Latitude increases, there is no significant change in Wind Speed. 
  - There is no relationship between Latitude and Cloudiness. As Latitude increases, there is no significant change in Cloudiness. 
  - There is a weak linear relationship between Latitude and Humidity. In the northern hemisphere, the relationship is direct: as Latitude increases, Humidity increases. In the southern hemisphere, the relationship is inverse: as Latitude increases, Humidity decreases.
  - There is a strong linear relationship between Latitude and Maximum Temperature. In the northern hemisphere, the relationship is inverse: as Latitude increases, Max Temperature decreases. In the southern hemisphere, the relationship is direct: as Latitude increases, Max Temperature increases.
  

# VacationPy
